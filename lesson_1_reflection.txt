How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped by only displaying the changes between the two versions,making
    it easy to spot the bud in minutes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me to track older and periodic changed versions of a file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Commits help unknown users to understand the changes made.
    Cons: Manual commits may sometimes be forgetful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Version contol systems like Git save multiple files in one commit because
    each file is related to one other saving it as one commit whereas in Google
    Docs, files are unrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: tells how many commits has been made in a repository.
    git diff: tells changes that are inserted/deleted by comparing with the previous
              commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control makes us confident by not worrying even when a mistake is
    made as we can go back to older version to sort it out.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try doing my projects using Git.
