What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When i initialize a repository only the files in that directory will be
    contained in the repository. I need to do it so that i can tract all the
    files in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    From the working directory we add the files that we want in the staging area,
    from where we commit these added files to the repository. Therefore, the value
    that i would like to give would be "Storage of added files ready to be committed"

change?
